# Exercise 1.16

## The Dockerfile

Since I deployed the coursepage itself on render.com, it didn't actually require a Dockerfile. But I have put it as it was a requirement for this exercise.

## What I did

I went to render.com, made an account and inputted the URL of the image: [docker.io/devopsdockeruh/coursepage](docker.io/devopsdockeruh/coursepage)

Then I set the environment variable PORT to 80 as the host's port 80 needs to be connected to the container's port 80 in order to view the hosted website.

Then I just published my app and waited for it to complete.

The hosted URL is: [https://devops-with-docker-coursepage.onrender.com/](https://devops-with-docker-coursepage.onrender.com/)
